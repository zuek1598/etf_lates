**Status:** ✅ FINALIZED

---

## 🎯 Decision

**We will use 252 TRADING DAYS for 1-year return calculations.**

This is the industry standard and aligns with professional financial analysis tools.

---

## 📊 Methodology

### **Formula:**
```python
one_year_return = (current_price - price_252_days_ago) / price_252_days_ago
```

### **Implementation:**
```python
# system/orchestrator.py line 241-243
if len(prices) >= 252:
    one_year_return = (prices.iloc[-1] - prices.iloc[-252]) / prices.iloc[-252]
    combined_results[ticker]['one_year_return'] = float(one_year_return)
```

## 🔍 Why Discrepancies Occur

### **Example: CRYP.AX**

| Source | Return | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Our System** | 58.93% (Oct 23) | 252 trading days |
| **TradingView** | 72.39% (Oct 24) | 365 calendar days |

**Reasons for difference:**
1. **Methodology:** 252 vs 365 days (~2-3%)
2. **Data freshness:** Oct 23 vs Oct 24 (~8-9%)
3. **Data source:** Yahoo vs ASX (~1-2%)

**Total difference:** ~13.46%

## 💡 User Communication

### **Dashboard Display:**

When displaying 1-year returns, we should:

1. **Label clearly:**
   ```
   1Y Return: +58.93%
   (Based on 252 trading days)
   ```

2. **Add tooltip:**
   ```
   "1-year return calculated using 252 trading days 
    (industry standard). Excludes weekends and holidays."
   ```

3. **Optional - Show both:**
   ```
   1Y Return (252 days): +58.93%
   1Y Return (365 days): +70.28%  [tooltip]
   ```

## 🔧 Data Freshness

### **Importance of Daily Updates:**

Since returns are sensitive to current prices, we should:

1. **Run analysis daily** (or more frequently)
2. **Display data age** on dashboard
3. **Allow manual refresh** for real-time needs

**Example impact:**
- 1 day old data: ~5-10% difference possible
- 1 week old data: ~10-20% difference possible
- 1 month old data: Significantly outdated

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### **Normal Variations:**

**Between our system and TradingView:**
- **2-5% difference:** Normal (methodology + timing)
- **5-10% difference:** Check data freshness
- **>10% difference:** Investigate (likely stale data or data issue)

**Between analysis runs:**
- **Daily:** 0-2% change (normal market movement)
- **Weekly:** 2-5% change (normal volatility)
- **Monthly:** 5-15% change (market trends)

---

## 🎯 Quality Checks

### **Red Flags:**

1. **Extreme Returns (>200% or <-50%):**
   - May indicate corporate actions (splits)
   - May indicate data quality issues
   - Flag for manual review

2. **YTD and 1Y Opposite Signs:**
   - Example: YTD -30%, 1Y +1140%
   - Suggests corporate action or data issue
   - Flag for investigation

3. **Large Discrepancy with Market:**
   - Compare to peer ETFs
   - Compare to benchmark
   - Verify data source
