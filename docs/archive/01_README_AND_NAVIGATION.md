## üí° KEY FEATURES

### Components
- **Risk Analysis:** CVaR, Ulcer Index, Beta, Information Ratio (30/30/20/20)
- **Technical:** Adaptive Kalman Hull Supertrend
- **ML:** Random Forest + Ridge ensemble (no bias correction)
- **Volume:** Spike detection, correlation, accumulation/distribution

### Fixes Implemented
1. ‚úÖ YTD Returns (from Jan 1st)
2. ‚úÖ CVaR Formula (correct t-distribution)
3. ‚úÖ Beta Calculation (statistical consistency)
4. ‚úÖ Information Ratio (proper annualization)
5. ‚úÖ Ulcer Index (correct methodology)
6. ‚úÖ Risk Normalization (data-driven bounds)
7. ‚úÖ ML Feature Scaling (cross-ETF comparability)
8. ‚úÖ Composite Penalties (percentage-based)
9. ‚úÖ Ulcer Scaling (extended bounds)

### Output
- Complete ETF universe analysis
- Rankings by risk category
- Top performers per category
- Comprehensive metrics per ETF

---

## üéì IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Critical Constraints**
1. **NO bias correction** in ML output (use raw + confidence)
2. **NO old momentum indicators** (KAMA, RSI, Stochastic, VWAP removed)
3. **Keep CVaR only** (VaR removed)
4. **30/30/20/20 weights** for risk component

### **Key Principles**
1. Write most efficient and shortest code possible
2. When working on hard parts - ultrathink
3. Do not create or invent new methodologies
4. Only use what's stated in specification
