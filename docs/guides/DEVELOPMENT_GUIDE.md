# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**Quick Reference:** How files were created and organized

---

## FILE ORGANIZATION STRATEGY

### Files Copied As-Is (No Changes)
These files work perfectly and were copied directly:

**From original system:**
- `data_manager/` (complete folder)
- `frameworks/` (complete folder)
- `utilities/walk_forward_validator.py`
- `analyzers/etf_risk_classifier.py`
- `system/config.py`
- `system/requirements.txt`

**Purpose:** Reuse tested, working components

---

### Files Modified
These files were copied as a base, then updated:

**1. analyzers/risk_component.py** (from statistical_analyzer.py)
- Renamed class to `RiskComponent`
- Removed all VaR calculations (kept CVaR only)
- Updated to 30/30/20/20 weighting (CVaR/Ulcer/Beta/IR)
- Added proper risk normalization with data-driven bounds

**2. analyzers/ml_ensemble.py** (from forecasting_engine.py)
- Renamed class to `MLEnsemble`
- **Removed all bias correction** (critical requirement)
- Added confidence score calculation
- Implemented robust feature scaling for cross-ETF comparability

**3. analyzers/scoring_system.py**
- Updated component weights: Risk(40%), Technical(30%), ML+Volume(30%)
- Replaced fixed penalties with percentage-based penalties
- Removed old momentum indicator scoring
- Added new scoring for Kalman Hull, ML Ensemble, Volume Intelligence

**4. utilities/shared_utils.py**
- Added 4 new helper functions for Kalman Hull and Volume Intelligence
- Removed helpers for old indicators (KAMA, RSI, Stochastic, VWAP)
- Kept core utilities for data extraction and quality assessment

**5. utilities/validators.py**
- Added validators for new components (Kalman Hull, Volume Intelligence, ML Ensemble)
- Updated to check for ABSENCE of bias correction fields
- Added risk component validator

**6. system/orchestrator.py**
- Updated to wire new components (RiskComponent, MLEnsemble, VolumeIntelligence)
- Added Kalman Hull calculation
- Fixed YTD return calculation (from Jan 1st, not 252 days back)
- Added proper data format handling

**7. system/schemas.py**
- Removed old schemas for momentum indicators
- Added schemas for new components
- Ensured no bias correction fields in ML schema

**8. dashboard/data_loader.py**
- Updated to load data for new components
- Verified all new fields are accessible

---

### Files Created From Scratch

**1. indicators/kalman_hull.py**
- Adaptive Kalman Hull Supertrend indicator
- Combines Kalman Filter + Hull MA + Supertrend bands
- Risk-category adaptive parameters
- Volatility regime detection

**2. analyzers/volume_intelligence.py**
- Volume Spike Index (RVR + Z-score)
- Price-Volume Correlation
- Accumulation/Distribution Line with divergence detection

## KEY PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED

1. **Efficiency:** Write shortest code possible while meeting all functionality
2. **No New Methodologies:** Only implement what's specified
3. **No Bias Correction:** Raw ML output with confidence scores
4. **Consistent Statistics:** Proper ddof, annualization throughout
5. **Data-Driven Bounds:** No arbitrary multipliers or thresholds
