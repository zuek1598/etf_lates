## Communication Style
- Be terse and direct
- Give the answer first, then explain reasoning if needed
- Flag explicitly if uncertain, disagree, or need clarification

## Code Quality
- Write the shortest, most efficient code that meets all requirements
- No unnecessary complexity or abstractions
- Prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and scalability
- Respect existing code style preferences

## Problem Solving & Workflow
- When facing complex problems, think deeply before responding
- Stick to stated methodologies - don't invent new approaches
- Anticipate needs and suggest solutions you might not have considered
- When facing an issue or an error - do agressive debugging with print statements and logging to see what is happening and where axactly where the system fails
- Create a todo list when working on complex tasks to track progress and remain on track
- Test counts and individual metrics must match exactly (no data corruption)

## File Organization
- Keep data in `/data` directory
- Analyzers in `/analyzers` directory
- Tests in root or `tests/` directory
- Utilities in `/utilities` directory
